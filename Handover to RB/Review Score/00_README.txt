This folder contains 2 main notebooks and an appendix folder. 

Please note the following instructions before running them:

1. Review_Score_Modeling.ipynb

    This notebook is created for model deployment.
    We imported a pre-prepared dataset for model training. Then selected a model based on the evaluation criteria. The model was then applied on a dataset we generated using RSC's data.


2. Review_Score_Feature_Engineering.ipynb

    This notebook is used to generate features for model fitting. 
    We used ReviewBox's data in addition to data scraped from amazon reviewers profiles to create features. We chose one brand namely RSC to form the output dataset.
    The output dataset was then used to feed the trained model.


3. Appendix

    Folder contains additional references.


Note: CSV files in this folder are the input files needed to run the notebooks.
